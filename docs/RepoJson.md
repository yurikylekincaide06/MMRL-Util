# `repo.json` documentation

> [!TIP]
> Non-array- and non-objects can also placed inside the `module.prop` file!
>
> To use this feature you need to create a file named `common/repo.json` in your module root folder

Supported file formats:
- `.json`
- `.yaml` (recommended when you target specific root solutions)

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure that edited or newly added properties are visible in the repository, you need to increase your module's version code.
